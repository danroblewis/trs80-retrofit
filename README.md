I am retro-fitting a TRS-80 Model 100 with a new screen and NVidia Jetson nano.

I will be mapping the keyboard to the jetson board, and after looking at 18650 battery pack drivers and usb-c charging I've decided oto just disassemble a high capacity USB battery. 

I'm trying to use an M.2 Key-E to Key-M converter board to get an nvme drive working in here. 

Might cram a hackrf or something fun into it. 

A 4g network adapter would be pretty dope.

I'm typing this in a `cat` session so goodbye and ctrl-d
